PREFACE.

Tun following Chapters have been selected chiefly
with reference to the rhetorical instruction they con·
tain. 'A greater variety ol topic's might heve been in·
troduced‚ had the Editor lelt himself at liberty to multe
alterations and abridgements in the portions selected.

The text ol Spalding’s edition hes been adopted: in
a lew instances‚ corrections have been mede by u rel·
erence to the supplementary volume ol Zumpt. The
captions of the several chapters have been taken from
the edition'ol Rollin. ·

As the Book is designed lor an advanoed cluss iu
college, the ambiguous words end cases have not been

marked, and but lew explanatory notes have men ap- ,
pended. There is a time when these sacilities should , y
be dispensed with, however important they may be in ² t

the earlier stages ol the student's course.

The Volume hes been prepared in compliance with
the advice ol several ol our most distinguished scholars
and insuucters. The attempt to promote the acquaint-
ance ol the student with “the most volueble writerxof
mtiquity’ cannot bc disapproved‚ though the execu-
tion may not be all tha't could be desired.
